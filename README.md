# Python Statistics and Probability Project

This repository contains solved exercises and practical examples in statistics and probability using Python. All files are designed for students learning the basics of data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:**  
  - `Ejercicio_1-estadistica_Aplicado-soluciones.ipynb`: Basic statistics exercises with explanations.
  - `Ejercicio_2-estadistica_Aplicado-soluciones.ipynb`: Probability exercises and data visualizations.
- **Data Files:**  
  - `airline-passengers.csv`: Dataset with monthly airline passenger numbers.
  - `winequality-white.csv`: Dataset about white wine quality parameters.
- **Scripts:**  
  - You may find Python scripts (`.py`) with helper functions or extra code.
- **Requirements:**  
  - `requirements.txt`: All libraries required to run the code.
- **README:**  
  - This file.

## Topics Covered

- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, etc.)
- Data visualization
- Probability distributions
- Regression (simple and multiple)
- Classification (k-NN, Decision Trees)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC/AUC)
- Time series analysis and ARIMA forecasting
