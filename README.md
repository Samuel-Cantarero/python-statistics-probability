# Python Statistics & Probability Exercises

This repository contains practical exercises and example scripts for learning statistics and probability using Python.
It is designed for beginners and students who want to understand basic statistical concepts, data analysis, and simulation techniques, all with clear and simple code.

## Contents

- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and data visualization.
- Probability distributions: simulation of Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson distributions.
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for means and proportions.
- Correlation: Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall coefficients calculated from scratch.
- Outlier detection and exploratory data analysis using real datasets (for example, wine quality).
- Data visualization: histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps for better understanding.

## Installation

1. Clone or unzip this repository.
2. Install the required libraries with:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn 

## How to use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or Python scripts (.py) in your preferred environment (such as Visual Studio Code or JupyterLab).
2. Run each cell and review the code comments and outputs.
   Each notebook is self-contained and shows both the formulas and Python implementations.

## Audience

- Students and beginners in Python programming and data science.
- Anyone wanting to learn statistics and probability in a practical way.
